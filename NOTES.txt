NOTES:

1. Got mySQL installed and working  
    To turn it on use:  mysql-ctl start
    To turn it off use:  mysql-ctl stop
    mySQL interactive shell: mysql-ctl cli

2. There's now a simple placeholder index.html for testing purposes.

3. I got the database created, named it whw, all the tables are created and loaded in.  If you're interested in how, I used the information in this website to load the data in using sql statements at the terminal.
    https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Database-in-MySQL
    
4. I got the GET (List) working for grounds/trees/shrubs. The url for testing these is: https://woodland-hills-woods-vivega.c9users.io/api/v1/grounds or trees or shrubs (after you start the server and mysql)

5. Added new index.html file that uses bootstrap 3 to build a table.

6. All REST working on server side, YAY!
    Testing in CURL complete using commands similar to:
    curl -X GET "https://woodland-hills-woods-vivega.c9users.io/api/v1/grounds/4"
    curl -X GET "https://woodland-hills-woods-vivega.c9users.io/api/v1/trees"
    curl -X DELETE "https://woodland-hills-woods-vivega.c9users.io/api/v1/grounds/1"
    curl -X POST "https://woodland-hills-woods-vivega.c9users.io/api/v1/grounds"
    curl -X PUT "https://woodland-hills-woods-vivega.c9users.io/api/v1/grounds/3"
    
7. Trees is now roughed into the index.html.
